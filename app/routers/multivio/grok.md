I'll help you examine the grok_router.py file from your project. Let me use sequential thinking to approach this systematically, then access the file.

After examining the grok_router.py file, I can provide you with a detailed breakdown of this component in your social media management platform.

# Grok Router Analysis

## Overview
The grok_router.py file implements API endpoints for integrating xAI's Grok AI functionality into your Multivio platform. It provides chat completion, streaming responses, vision capabilities, and function calling features.

## Key Components

### Configuration
- Uses the Grok API via environment variables (`XAI_API_KEY` and `GROK_API_BASE_URL`)
- Supports two Grok models: "grok-2-1212" and "grok-2-vision-1212"
- Includes a default system prompt with markdown formatting instructions

### Core Functionality
1. **Chat Completion**: Text-based AI assistance for user queries
2. **Vision Processing**: Ability to analyze and respond to image inputs
3. **Function Calling**: Framework for Grok to call registered functions (weather, calculations, web search)
4. **Conversation Management**: CRUD operations for managing chat conversations

### Database Integration
- Stores conversations in `mo_llm_conversations` table
- Tracks messages in `mo_llm_messages` table
- Manages function calls in `mo_llm_function_calls` table

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/models` | GET | Lists available Grok models |
| `/functions` | GET | Lists available functions |
| `/functions/call` | POST | Executes a function directly |
| `/conversations` | GET | Lists all user conversations |
| `/conversations/{id}` | GET | Gets conversation details |
| `/conversations` | POST | Creates a new conversation |
| `/conversations/{id}` | DELETE | Deletes a conversation |
| `/chat` | POST | Creates a chat completion |
| `/chat/stream` | POST | Streams a chat response |
| `/chat/vision` | POST | Processes vision-based requests |

## Key Classes

1. **GrokClient**: Handles communication with the Grok API
2. **FunctionRegistry**: Manages the available functions that Grok can call
3. **Message/VisionMessage**: Data models for request/response structures

## Integration with Multivio Platform
This router integrates with your user authentication system and database to provide AI assistance alongside your social media management features. It allows:

1. Persistent conversations tied to user accounts
2. Multi-modal interactions (text + images)
3. Function execution for enhanced capabilities
4. Streaming responses for better user experience

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows FastAPI best practices with:
- Dependency injection for database and authentication
- Background task processing
- Streaming responses
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging
