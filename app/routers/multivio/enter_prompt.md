Agent: Thank you for calling Acme Smart Home Support. This is Alex. How may I assist you today?
Customer: Hi Alex, my Acme SmartTherm isn't maintaining the temperature I set. It's set to 72 but the house is much warmer.
Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's troubleshoot. Is your SmartTherm connected to Wi-Fi?
Customer: Yes, the Wi-Fi symbol is showing on the display.
Agent: Great. Let's recalibrate your SmartTherm. Press and hold the menu button for 5 seconds.
Customer: Okay, done. A new menu came up.
Agent: Perfect. Navigate to "Calibration" and press select. Adjust the temperature to match your room thermometer.
Customer: Alright, I've set it to 79 degrees to match.
Agent: Great. Press select to confirm. It will recalibrate, which may take a few minutes. Check back in an hour to see if it's fixed.

Agent: Acme Smart Home Support, this is Jamie. How can I help you?
Customer: Hi, I just installed my new Acme SmartCam, but I can't get it to connect to my Wi-Fi.
Agent: I'd be happy to help. Are you using the Acme Smart Home app?
Customer: Yes, I have the app on my phone.
Agent: Great. Make sure your phone is connected to the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network, not the 5GHz one.
Customer: Oh, I'm on the 5GHz network. Should I switch?
Agent: Yes, please switch to the 2.4GHz network. The SmartCam only works with 2.4GHz.
Customer: Okay, done. Now what?
Agent: Open the app, select 'Add Device', choose 'SmartCam', and follow the on-screen instructions.
Customer: It's asking for a password now.
Agent: Enter your Wi-Fi password and it should connect.
Customer: It's still not working. I keep getting an error message.
Agent: I see. In that case, I'd like to escalate this to our technical team. They'll contact you within 24 hours.
